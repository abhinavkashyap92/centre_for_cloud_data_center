									<h4>About Centre for Cloud computing and Big data</h4>
									<p>The PESIT,  Centre for Cloud Computing and Big Data has been set up under the aegis of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering as a platform to enable research &amp; technical exchange and educate the  students on cloud computing sciences and technologies needed.</p>
 									<h4>This centre currently has three focus areas.</h4> 
									<ol>
											      <li>To provide common infrastructure, research environment and technical guidance for students and academicians.</li> 
											
											     <li>To work with the Industry in terms of current technological problems &amp; challenges and come up with solutions which can make an impact in the technological directions.</li> 
											
											     <li>To be a major catalyst for the building of Open Source communities in the country.</li>
										</ol>

									 
									<p>These activities will provide a platform for  students and professors, industry partners and government agencies to work on real solutions based on cloud computing that will align people and technology effectively.</p>
									 
									<p>The centre is starting with a small state of the art lab with around 25+ servers and other components necessary for the cloud environment. We also have committed multiyear investment by PESIT to the data centre and additionally to match industry grants for research.  Open source cloud infrastructure like the Openstack is being used as the building block for the centre, which is aligned with the objective of the centre to be a major contributor to Open Source in the areas of Cloud Computing and Big Data.</p>
									 
									<p>The cloud is currently organized into environments for cloud research projects, production environments for UG course labs and some crash and burn systems. We have a team of highly qualified Industry &amp; Research focussed staff members driving the curriculum and activities around the Cloud centre. Thus this sets up a centre offering new cloud-focused academic courses which is available to be chosen by around 1000 UG and PG students studying in Computer Science and Information sciences branches.</p>
									 
									<p>Our research focuses on the following areas:
										Hybrid clouds: These are becoming widespread since they can offer the security of private clouds together with the low capital expense and scalability of public clouds. We are studying 
									</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Security infrastructures for seamless integration of multiple clouds</li> 
											<li>Policies and algorithms for resource allocation in hybrid clouds</li> 
											<li>Efficient scheduling given constraints such as (relatively) low network bandwidth between clouds</li> 
											<li>Performance modelling and monitoring of cloud systems</li>
									 	</ul>

									<p>Big Data: We are studying a number of interesting topics in the area of Big Data infrastructures and applications </p>
									<ul>
										 <li>Efficient methods of providing Big Data as a service on cloud systems</li>
										 <li>Performance modelling and monitoring of Big Data systems</li> 
										 <li>Scalability of Big Data systems</li> 
										 <li>Cloud scale brain computing</li>
										<li>Real-time big data applications</li>
									</ul>
